# DESeq analysis in R for parental transcriptome data (A. thaliana and A. lyrata) 

# Initial step is to generate count reads associated with expression with HTSeq. 
#to quantify gen expression, it can be used following command within HTSeq 

htseq-count [options] <alignment.sam> <annotation.gtf> > /path/file_count.count

#note: alignment files are unique sam files which are derived within mapping, where gff file is annotation for corresponding reference genotype

# DESeq2 provides analysis of count data from RNA_Seq to detect differentially expressed genes. DESeq works based on negative binomial generalized linear model.
#As input files is necessary to gather all count file that passed RNA Integrity check (for RNA Integrity QC, please refer to the).
#All count files should be in txt format placed at the working directory.
#If working with two or more different species (e.g., close relatives such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata or Arabidopsis halleri), it is necessary to obtain ortholog genes within species. 

# DESeq2 is run in R using Bioconductor available: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html
